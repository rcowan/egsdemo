egsdemo
=======

EGSdemo provides graphical demonstrations of electron-gamma showers in materials using the EGS (Electron-Gamma Showers)  Code System.  EGSdemo is intended as a teaching tool for understanding radiation transport processes in simple geometries.  Detailed studies of radiation transport processes including fluence and dose calculations should use the full EGS Code System, available at http://rcwww.kek.jp/research/egs/ or http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/egsnrc_index.html.
